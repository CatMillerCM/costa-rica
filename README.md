# Costa Eu-rica!

Welcome to Costa Rica's project: Costa Eu-rica!

Inspired by the country's amazing flora and fauna, this app was created after wonderful national park visits, with many lucky animal spottings. I wanted to bring them to life in this quiz, and teach the user some fun facts as well!

Have a go at this fun and interactive quiz about Costa Rica's famous animals, and see which native creature best describes your efforts! You can even share your result.

Hosted independently [here](https://costa-rica.cat-miller.com/).

A full write up, with further information about the project, can be found on [What's My Country Code - Costa Rica](https://whatsmycountrycode.cat-miller.com/costa-rica).
